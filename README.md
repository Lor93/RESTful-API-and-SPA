# RESTful-API-and-SPA

This contaitn a simple RESTful API that will work with POSTman and VS code.
This is all done in node.js with the xpress freamework. It will run with the 
command prompt of --node main.js-- which will then launch in the broswer on 
--localhost:3000--. WHen it run on the browser it will only display the full
users.json list. If you wnat to manipluate it more, use POOSTman to do more with 
the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE function. 
The second file will contain a SPA (Single Page Assignment), with a
form base setup. The main file for this SPA is with the index.js.
To use it you will have to run -- http-server -- in terminal 
tha will run on the broswer with -- localhost:8080 --. With this SPA you can enter 
any number form 1 to 30 and it wil display a user infromation.
